## Description

Custom theme for Redmine.

I created a theme using Cool Colors with an awareness of making the interface look more modern than the default Redmine.
The position and color scheme of the menu are close to the default theme, so even those who are familiar with existing themes can use it without any discomfort.

Bleuclair theme is used as standard for [RedMica - the future Redmine you can get today](https://www.farend.co.jp/products/redmica/) (RedMica is yet another distribution of Redmine)

## Demo

### For Redmine 4.2 or later :new:

From Bleuclair compatible with Redmine 4.2, changes such as replacing the icon with an icon font and adding the folding feature of the sidebar have been added.
